If you try to install PyAudio without PortAudio, you will get an error like,

 src/_portaudiomodule.c:29:23: fatal error: portaudio.h: No such file or directory  
    #include "portaudio.h"  
               ^  
   compilation terminated.  
   error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1  


You need to install the PortAudio development package by,

 sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev  

Then, you can install PyAudio using pip,

 pip install pyaudio
